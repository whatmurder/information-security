## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses).

To install tor you first navigate to the Tor Project website: https://www.torproject.org/download/

Since we're on linux we click the `Download for Linux` button.

You should now have it downloaded on your computer and it should be in the location you chose. In my case it's in the downloads folder.

Now we open the terminal and locate to the downloads folder:

    cd Downloads

We've arrived. The file we downloaded is an archive, which means we have to exctract it to gain access to its contents.
In the terminal we run this command:

    tar xf tor-browser-linux-x86_64-14.0.7.tar.xz

Fun fact: I typed out that entire file name manually by hand!

Now if you didn't get any errors you should have a new directory in your downloads directory.

Then we go into that directory:

    cd tor-browser

Then to launch the Tor browser you run the command:

    ./start-tor-browser.desktop

![tor-launch](https://github.com/whatmurder/information-security/blob/main/img/h7-a-02.png)

We launched it!

We're not connected to any network immediately, so now we just click the `Connect` button.

We're connected, let's get to browsing!

## b) Browse TOR network

### Search engine

Ahmia is a search engine that can find .onion sites

### Marketplace

BusKill is a website where you can purchase USB-killcords for your laptop. 

![buskill-01](https://github.com/whatmurder/information-security/blob/main/img/h7-b-03.png)

*"What's a killcord?"* you may ask. This USB-killcord is a device/thingmajig/contraption/whatever that plugs into your laptop, and when removed - you guessed it - kills the laptop by either shutting it down or just wiping the thing

The website describes it better:

*"BusKill can trigger your laptop to lock, shutdown, or self-destruct if itâ€™s physically separated from you."*

### Forum(s)

You can got on reddit on the darkweb. There's no escaping redditors...

There's also a reddit-esque forum called Dread, which discusses darkweb related topics.

Personal favourite: The fentanyl thread.

### A site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

CIA. I don't have a quip for this one.
