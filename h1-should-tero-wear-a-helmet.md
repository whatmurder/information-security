### Threat Modeling

1. Threat Modeling Manifesto
   * The Threat Modeling Manifesto goes over what threat modeling is, why threat model, who is it for and who should do threat modeling (The answer? Everybody)
   * The authors intend the manifesto to be used as a guide to develop security measures/methology to fit your means and help you develop things in a more secure way whatever it is that you're developing
   * The manifesto provides two guidelines for the reader/user (*Values* and *Principles*)

2. Shostack 2022
   *  The video series is basically a 101 or the basics of what threat modeling is and goes over the core subjects of threat modeling.
   *  A thing that Adam brings up often and what the Threat Modeling Manifesto also brought up is the importance of collaborating.
   *  The most important question in threat modeling is *"What can go wrong?"*

3. OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet
   * As the name implies it's a cheatsheet where you can read brief explanations and guidelines of what threat modeling is and what are included in the threat modeling process
   * In the references there are links to multiple different threat modeling techniques and tools that get used in threat modeling
  
### Infosec Scene

I decided to pick the episodes 45 & 46 which goes over the history of the hacking group Xbox Underground.

* The XBox Underground was a hacking group that managed to hack into the servers of Microsoft and EpicGames, granting the group access to unreleased games (including *Gears of War 3* and a Apache helicopter simulator developed for the US Army), and the prototype plans of the XBOX 360 successor, XBOX One.
* The group used social engineering and phising to gain access to the servers, and eventually even copied a Microsoft employess keycard to go into the Microsoft/XBOX headquarters to steal a copy of the XBOX One prototype. They also sold cheats and hacks to non-hacking Xbox players
