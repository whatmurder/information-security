## x) Read and summarize

## a) Goat

Installing *Webgoat* was pretty straight forward by following the guide given, only thing that took a little more research was installing *wget*.
I thought I remembered how to install new programs on Linux but it seems I mistyped the install command, so I googled how to install it.

This is how I tried to do it at first:

    sudo apt get wget
    
Which of course didn't work. So I did a little googling and found out the proper command:

    sudo apt install wget

That worked and now we have wget on our Debian installation, wahoo.

After that I followed to guide again, launched *Webgoat*, made an account (after disconnecting from the internet of course) and tadah:

## b) F12

## c) Not outdated

So I actually just installed this Debian instance today and fully updated it, but here's a screenshot of me updating and -grading it again:
