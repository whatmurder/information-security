### Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains in a nutshell

* The abstract and the introduction chapters introduce us to APTs (Advanced Persistent Threat)
	* APTs are well researched and (as their name suggests) advanced attacks that target highly sensitive economic, proprietary, or
national security information.
	* Unlike more common virus/malware attacks, APTs are manually operated calculated attacks that have extensive planning behind them. Anti-virus programs and vulnerability patching are not sufficient to prevent these types of attacks.
	* APT attacks usually follow a so called "Kill Chain", which consists of steps that the attack follows.

* Kill Chain is a systematic process to attack the desired target. The kill chain described in the paper consists of seven steps:
	1. Reconnaissance
 	2. Weaponization
  	3. Delivery
  	4. Exploitation
  	5. Installation
  	6. Command and Control
  	7. Actions on Objectives

 * By analyzing the kill chain the defender can develop a more robust defences against APTs and other types of attacks and can help the defender to slow down, stop or deter the possible attack.
	* The killchain model *"[...]serves as a framework to measure the effectiveness of the defendersâ€™ actions"*
