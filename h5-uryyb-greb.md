## d) Password manager, open and cloudless

I personally use Bitwarden as my password manager of choice, it's open-source and free. I have it running on my browser as a browser extension and on my phone. I've used it for 4+ years by now.
But for the sake of the exercise we'll use something locally running, and the manager I chose is KeePassXC. It's free, open-source and local. Wowzers.

### Installation

To install KeePassXC on Debian you run the command

    sudo apt install keepassxc

After the command runs its course, you can launch your freshly installed password manager from the applications menu.
