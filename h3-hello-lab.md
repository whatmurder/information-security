## x) Read/watch/listen

I've installed Debian and other Linux distros before so reading the documents weren't *that* necessary for me, but I still skimmed through them

I installed neofetch for fun because it's cool and I don't care that it's deprecated.

Some thoughts on the reading material and the Debian installation:

* The *Command Line Basics Revisited* document is in my opinion super useful and should probably be taught to everybody who comes to study computer science in Haaga-Helia
* I haven't used the *XFCE* desktop enviroment before, it seems fairly lightweight and easy to use for beginners. Visually I don't enjoy it that much, I prefer *Gnome* over it.
